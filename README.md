# GTFS Merger

Welcome to GTFS Regional Merger, a tool designed to combine multiple General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files into a single, cohesive file. This program is intended to be used as a GitHub Action workflow in the [Carris Metropolitana GTFS repository](https://github.com/carrismetropolitana/gtfs) to automate the process of merging GTFS feeds.

Our goal is to simplify the management of large datasets and provide comprehensive transit information for our riders. By using GTFS Merger, we aim to streamline our GTFS management process and improve access to essential regional transit data. This tool can be adapted to suit the needs of any organization that works with GTFS files, so we hope it will be useful for others in the public transit community.
